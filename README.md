Mersenne Twister
================
Pseudo Random Number Generator in NASM
--------------------------------------

This is my implementation of the Mersenne Twister algorythm in NASM.
It is based on the psuedo-code taken from Wikipedia:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_Twister


1. makefile     - Builds the test program
2. mtwister.asm - This is the Mersenne Twister code
3. psuedocode   - Psuedo code taken from Wikipedia
4. README.md    - This file
5. testmt.asm   - This is a quick test program for the above, running on Linux
